## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate junior developer who believes that **every algorithm behind the code has to do with AI**. From the logic that powers a simple sorting function to the neural networks driving modern applications, I see artificial intelligence as the foundation of intelligent software development.

My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and the belief that understanding AI principles makes you a better developer, regardless of your stack. I'm constantly exploring how machine learning, data structures, and algorithmic thinking can create more efficient, intelligent, and user-centric applications.

## 💭 My Philosophy

> "Every algorithm is a form of intelligence. From a simple if-statement making decisions to complex neural networks recognizing patterns, we're always encoding intelligence into our code. Understanding this connection makes us better developers."

I approach every project with the mindset that we're not just writing code—we're creating intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and solve problems. This perspective drives me to write cleaner algorithms, optimize performance, and always consider the computational thinking behind every solution.
